<h1>The Wizard of OZ!</h1>


<p><strong><span id="female1"></span></strong> lived in the midst of the great <strong><span in="state"></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span id="geofeat1"></span></strong>, with Uncle <strong><span id="uncle1"></span></strong>, who was a </p>

<p><strong><span id="occupation"></span></strong>, and Aunt <strong><span id="aunt1"></span></strong>, who was the farmer's wife.</p>

<p>Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many</p>

<p>miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this</p>

<p>room contained a rusty looking <strong><span id="noun1"></span></strong>, a <strong><span id="noun2"></span></strong> for the</p>

<p>dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle <strong><span id="uncle2"></span></strong> and</p>

<p>Aunt <strong><span id="aunt2"></span></strong> had a big bed in one corner, and <strong><span id="female2"></span></strong> a</p>

<p>little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small</p>

<p>hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one</p>

<p>of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It</p>

<p>was reached by a trap door in the middle of the <strong><span id="noun3"></span></strong>, from which a</p>

<p>ladder led down into the small, dark hole</p>

<br>

<p>When <strong><span id="female3"></span></strong> stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see</p>

<p>nothing but the great <strong><span id="color1"></span></strong> <strong><span id="geofeat2"></span></strong> on every</p>

<P>side. Not a <strong><span id="noun4"></span></strong> nor a <strong><span id="noun5"></span></strong> broke the broad sweep of</P>

<p>flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked</p>

<p>the plowed land into a <strong><span id="color2"></span></strong> mass, with little cracks running through it.</p>

<p>Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades</p>

<p>until they were the same <strong><span id="color3"></span></strong> color to be seen everywhere. Once the</p>

<p>house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it</p>

<p>away, and now the house was as dull and <strong><span id="color4"></span></strong> as everything else.</p>
